### Hi!  Welcome to my space on GitHub.
### I'm Nic Dublanko aka Nicky Dubs and I am a loopstation musician.  ðŸ‘‹
### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently exploring web+coding tools & attempting to learn new (automated?) ways to help me grow my online presence/audience geared aroud my Musical live streams on Twitch/Youtube.  I use the Boss RC-505 loopstation, a Roland Octapad and a Microkorg among other shits.  I am primarily a drummer but I also have a deep passion for synth playing and using my vocals for the good of music. 
### 
### ðŸ˜„ I love using all my skills all at once to create captivating musical journeys for the fun of the listener and for the healing it provides me.  At the end of the day I just try my best to make good music, you know?  And like hopefully one day within a couple years here I will afford to eat and pay rent through my passions/talents.  I fully committed my life to my solo music project in 2015 and have seen my life change drastically for the better as I become a more competent wizard with sounds and live music performance.  Like, you know, to a crowd in real life or whatever..  yeah.  Come on world of 2021, let's slay some dragons and enjoy life again.
###
### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning deep/funky house music styles, always getting better at reggae and deep bass/grooves/feels.  Also working on incorporating live drum kit in cool ways with looping, like especially know how to drop the bomb to finish any looper creation in full force + style.
###
### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with marketing + leveraging my Musical live streams and Youtube content such that I can pay my rent from my talents which I cherish and work on always.
### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything musical/computer related.
### ðŸ“« How to reach me: nickydubsmusic@gmail.com or else through my Twitch or Discord!
### âš¡ Fun fact: I once blew a 2 minute and 15 second long fart.  And I have a minute and forty second one on tape!
### k bye!
